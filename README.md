### What is Jupiter?

Our main product is our L1 blockchain, Jupiter. Jupiter is the base platform needed to run the [Gravity](https://github.com/jupiter-project/gravity) framework for information storage and decentralized application building. Jupiter is built from [Nxt's](https://nxt.org) system based on cryptography and blockchain technology. On top of this anyone can have assets, currencies, aliases, data, messaging, a DEX, and NFTs.

Currently, our primary decentralized application is [Metis](https://getmetis.io), a decentralized messaging system that is double encrypted and requires no personally identifiable information \(PII\) to create an account. We are going through rebranding now with new logo and website presence.
